Design ONLY the UI and UX for Boundier. 
Do NOT generate or mention backend code, APIs, Chrome extension logic, or databases.

The UI must represent how Boundier analyzes Influence, Distortion, and Echo Drift in digital content — but the interface should not show raw text extraction or technical complexity.
